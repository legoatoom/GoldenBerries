## Description
Golden Berries is a small Minecraft mod for Fabric that adds golden berries to the game.

Golden Berries are crafted just like a Golden Carrot, only instead using sweet berries instead of a carrot. 

Golden Berries can be used to craft Potions of Alexiteric, these give immunity against poison effect, and limit the damage from the wither effect to 2 hearts for 45 seconds. (Your health bar changes appropriately) Potions of Alexiteric are extendable to 90 seconds by adding redstone.
